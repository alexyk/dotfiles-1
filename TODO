Things I'd like to have:
  * binding for a small horizontal split in tmux to run gitx (or other stuff)
    while I am waiting for specs/features to complete
  * REFACTOR marks as a vim bundle
    - list all REFACTOR marks in quickfix
    - rf snippet
    - a git pre-commit hook that complains if there is a REFACTOR mark?
  * Try gitv in Vim
  * https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes
  * Add Vundle
  * Check out highlighting long lines at Mange's dotfiles
  * Add a mapping for toggling between set number and set relativenumber
  * Get Vim indentation in Ruby to work
  * Cannot enter normal mode when nexus is running
  * Move adding nexus segment to nexus itself
  * vim-refactor
  * vim-nexus error format fails when there is no :in at the end
  * gVim flashes when running tests because of cfgetlist
