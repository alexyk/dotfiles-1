Things I'd like to have:
  * binding for a small horizontal split in tmux to run gitx (or other stuff)
    while I am waiting for specs/features to complete
  * REFACTOR marks as a vim bundle
    - list all REFACTOR marks in quickfix
    - rf snippet
    - a git pre-commit hook that complains if there is a REFACTOR mark?
